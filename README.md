# Interlinked - Cross Chain Escrow Service

Interlinked helps you transfer your assets on any chain without ever having to worry about losing them, ever again.

Trust and Security: An escrow smart contract reduces the risk of fraud by acting as a neutral party and ensuring proper escrow logic execution.

Transparency: Operations happening in the system are transparent as relevant transactions are accessible to all blockchain participants.

Efficiency: Blockchain eliminates the need for third parties, which in turn helps to reduce transaction costs and enhance service efficiency.
